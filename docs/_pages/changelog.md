# Changelog
Check out how Binary Clock has evolved over time!

<br>

### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
Instead of the digits 1, 2, 3, etc... this clock uses columns of dots that turn
on and off like the 1s and 0s of the binary form of the number.

Binary Clock also includes several settings you can use to personalize the clock
to your liking. Just press and hold the clock to access them.

Check out the blog post explaining [how to tell time on a Binary
Clock](https://links.jhale.dev/binaryclock), if you don't already know how!
