## Quick Start

### Step 1: Fork this repo.
After forking the repo, your site will be live immediately on your personal Github Pages account, e.g. `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

### Step 2: Enter iOS App ID in `_config.yml`
To textget started, enter your iOS app ID in the `ios_app_id` field and commit your changes. Your site will automatically rebuild with your app's icon, name, price and link to App Store.

You can go on with customising almost anything in the `_config.yml` file. 

Things you can customise in `_config.yml`:
- App Name
- App Icon
- App Description
- App Price
- App Store Link
- Play Store Link
- Press Kit Download Link
- Cover Image
- Cover Overlay Color
- Background Color
- Text Colors
- iPhone Device Color
- Your Name / Company Name
- Link to Website
- Social Links and Contact Info
- Feature List (Title, text, icon)

### Step 3: Add screenshot or video

#### Adding a screenshot
Upload a `.png` or `.jpg` of your app to the folder `assets/screenshot/`. The name does not matter. Be sure to delete the placeholder `yourscreenshot.png`.

#### Adding video
Upload your video to the folder `assets/videos/`. To have support for most browsers, you need to upload two files – one for Safari and one for Chrome/Firefox.

Video formats supported by Chrome and Firefox:
- `.webm`
- `.ogg`

Video formats supported by Safari:
- `.mp4`
- `.mov`

#### Resolutions
The videos and screenshots must have one of the following resolutions:
- 828x1792
- 1125x2436
- 1242x2688
