**Create and deploy a landing page for your iOS app in a few of minutes.**

Designed for GitHub Pages for super easy set up. Just fork this repo, edit _config.yml, upload screenshot/video and push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch. Voilá! Your site will become immediately viewable on your personal Github Pages account, e.g. `https://username.github.io/your-repos-name/`.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Fork this repo.
After forking the repo, your site will often be live immediately on your personal Github Pages account, e.g. `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repos-name/`.

### Step 2: Edit `_config.yml` to customize for your app
Once you have forked the repo, you can customize almost anything via the `_config.yml` file. To get started, enter your iOS app ID in the `ios_app_id` field.

Things you can customise in `_config.yml`:
- App Name
- App Icon
- App Description
- App Price
- App Store Link
- Play Store Link
- Press Kit Download Link
- Header Image
- Header Color
- Background Color
- Text Colors
- iPhone Device Color
- Your Name
- Link to Website
- Social Links and Contact Info
- Feature List (Title, text, icon)

### Step 3: Add screenshot or video

#### Adding a screenshot
Upload a `.png` or `.jpg` of your app to the folder `assets/screenshot/`. The name does not matter.

#### Adding video
Upload your video to the folder `assets/videos/`. To have support for most browsers, you need to upload two files – one for Safari and one for Chrome/Firefox.

Video formats supported by Chrome and Firefox:
- `.webm`
- `.ogg`

Video formats supported by Safari:
- `.mp4`
- `.mov`

#### Resolutions
The videos and screenshots must have one of the following resolutions:
- 828x1792
- 1125x2436
- 1242x2688
